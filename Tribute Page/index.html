                                        <p><strong>He will be keep living in my life</strong><br>
                                            I'm sad to know the death of Steve Job. I've started learning Multimedia art from 2001. Because of Final Cut Pro, I've switched to Apple computer and quickly tasted the cleverness of Apple machine and it's software. When I first time heard Keynotes of Steve Job, I was overwhelmed by his soft-spoken speech. I have a Mac computer, iPhone85 I'm living with his inventions. It is hard to hear his death. His contribution had been so much to Multimedia artists and it is no longer a specific field of people for Apple products. They support Art and made art for everyone. He is one of the kind, who I am grateful living at the same time. His creative, innovative, leader of modern life style will never died. He will be keep living in my life. His ideas, styles, forever. Thank you, Steve Jobs. <br/>

                                            <p><strong>Goodbye Steve</strong><br>
                                                Goodbye Steve... Steve has always been and will be an idol for me and for the people connected with technology and the computer area.  I started my course in computer science and I followed its trajectory in his inspiring life story.  Steve always showed that he was a very strong and powerfull man, it's a huge example for the society. I'm sure Steve is in heaven creating new technologies for us. I love you Steve, Hugs of a big fan from Brazil. <br/>

                                                    I find it incredibly ironic that the day I learned how to use online library databases in my University from my Apple computer, and I took a study break to watch TV, that I learned of Steve's passing. I owe everything to this man, because without my personal computer, library research would be all but impossible. I remember saving all of my Christmas money and work money to buy my first iPod at age 16. It was the first generation video iPod. On long car trips, walks, a trip to Europe, I took it everywhere, and still take my nano to class and work. When I went to college, I chose a Mac because of its easy usage and great customer support. Four years later, I am still using this Mac, and tonight from the University of Minnesota I am writing and researching my college honors thesis. I don't have an iPhone, iPad, or many of the gadgets others use at this point in time; I'm quite old fashioned and prefer to read material books, not much for touch screens, etc. But it wasn't until today how I learned just how revolutionary the digital world can be, and I will always remember that Steve innovated my favorite calming device and researching tool. Even if I wasn't the nerdiest, tech-savvy girl out there, Steve had something to offer. Thanks so much for making my college life easier, less-stressful, and for opening a larger perspective of the world. <br/>

Ever since I purchased my first iPhone 3G, I've always wanted to have some position working at apple. I hope that you are in peace now, and I know everybody will always miss and remember you, the person who changed the world. The man who affected millions of people. I know you've changed the way that I have lived my life, and I thank you for that. RIP Steve. <br/>
